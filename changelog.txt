v4.7-beta-2

- Added support for UV Face Rotation
- Added a deferred GeoRenderProvider for split-sources support
- Added a stop triggered animation function, to allow for stopping of triggered animations in the same way you triggered them in the first place
- Added a fallback hook for animations - you can now declare multiple animation files in a single GeoModel to look for animations (for polymorphic/modular animatables)
- GeoModels now receive the renderer in #getTextureResource and #getModelResource, to allow for render-context dependent models and textures
- Keyframe events now have the AnimationState passed to them for additional context
- Moved the AnimationState creation in GeoRenderer to its own method for easy overriding
- Pass the render colour from the renderer to the render layers
- Fixed Color#ofARGB actually being RGBA
- Removed previously deprecated methods
- Fixed some issues with Entity and ReplacedEntity geo renderers
- Fixed entity velocity being determined mostly from x-coordinate velocity
- Fixed the controller-agnostic triggered anim function not working
- Introduced additional safeties to prevent unexpected crashes for some networking functions
- Moved animated texture ticking to an internal handler, preventing GeoRenderer implementations from needing to handle it
