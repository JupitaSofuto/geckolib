v4.7-beta-1

- Update to 1.21.3
    - THIS IS A BREAKING VERSION. I have released this so modders dependent on GeckoLib can begin porting, but I have breaking changes to come
    - EntityRenderState is wrapped and ignored - you do not need to worry about this when using GeckoLib (for now)
- Removed the `query.is_powered` molang query as it is no longer practically feasible
- Change crashes to warnings for unsupported model format versions for geo models
- Fix incorrect version range for NeoForge mods
