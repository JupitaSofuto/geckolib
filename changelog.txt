v4.8

- Update to 1.21.4
- Fix a potential stuck InputStream when loading glowmasks
- Fixed Geo animated textures not properly supporting customised frametimes
- GeckoLib now requires a `assets/modid/item` json file to define its rendering as being special.
Will be investigating ways to streamline this in the future, see
